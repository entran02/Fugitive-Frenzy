## cloning repo

For version controlling unity it is highly suggested that only the assets, packages, and project settings folders are in the repo.
Because of this, you will have to create a project with the same name and then VC those 3 folders, or if it is easier I can share my
project file via drive and then you can set up VC after with just the 3 folders.
